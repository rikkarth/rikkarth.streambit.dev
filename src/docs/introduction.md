Deeply passionate about software development and gaming, constantly seeking to expand my skills and contribute meaningfully to the field.

My journey into programming was sparked by my love for video games, which also taught me a lot about problem-solving.

I consider myself a bit of a nerd, always eager to learn more about the world around me, especially when it comes to science and technology.
